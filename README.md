# ThunderSimLineup

Opensource android app for the users of the WarThunder combined simulator battle mode.

Using this application, the user can get info on active lineups, and tanks/planes/helis are taking apart on the current lineup. Also, there is a notification about favorite vehicles so that you don't miss this event.
